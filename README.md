This code defines an abstract class `RestAPIProcessor` that provides a framework for processing REST API requests in a structured way. The methods in this class are interconnected and serve specific roles in the lifecycle of processing REST API requests and their responses.

Hereâ€™s how the methods relate to each other:

---

### **1. `processRequest`**
- **Purpose**: This method orchestrates the sequence of steps needed to process a REST API request.
- **Flow**:
  1. Calls the **abstract** method `PreProcess()` (which must be implemented by derived classes) to handle any preparatory work before making the API call.
  2. Checks the `skipRestAPICall` flag. If `true`, the API call is skipped.
  3. If not skipped, calls the `CallRestAPI()` method to send the actual API requests.
- **Relation**:
  - Acts as the main entry point for processing requests.
  - Delegates the actual API call to `CallRestAPI`.
  - Relies on `PreProcess()` to prepare the `restApiRequests`.

---

### **2. `CallRestAPI`**
- **Purpose**: This method sends the API requests using `HttpClient` and processes the responses.
- **Flow**:
  1. Iterates over the `restApiRequests` list.
  2. For each request:
     - Retrieves an appropriate **retry policy** using `RetryPolicyHelper`.
     - Sends the request (e.g., `GET` or `POST`) based on the request method.
     - Adds authentication tokens to the headers by calling the `tokenManager`.
     - Captures the time taken to execute the API call.
     - Categorizes the response as success or failure, updating the `restApiProcessingResult` accordingly.
  3. Maintains a separation of successful and failed responses for further processing.
- **Relation**:
  - It is the core method called by `processRequest` for sending API requests.
  - Depends on the `PreProcess()` method to ensure `restApiRequests` is populated.
  - Populates the `restApiProcessingResult` with the outcome of the requests.

---

### **3. `processResponse`**
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates the post-processing of the API responses after they have been received.
- **Flow**:
  1. Calls the **abstract** method `PostProcess()` (to be implemented by derived classes) for custom logic to process the API responses stored in `restApiProcessingResult`.
- **Relation**:
  - Complements `processRequest`.
  - Relies on `CallRestAPI` having updated `restApiProcessingResult` with successful or failed responses.
  - Leaves the specifics of response processing to the implementation of `PostProcess()`.

---

### **4. `PreProcess` (Abstract)**
- **Purpose**: Prepares the `restApiRequests` list or performs any setup before calling the API.
- **Relation**:
  - Must be implemented by a derived class to populate `restApiRequests` with valid requests.
  - Called at the beginning of `processRequest` to ensure all requests are prepared.

---

### **5. `PostProcess` (Abstract)**
- **Purpose**: Defines custom logic for handling the results of the API calls after they are made.
- **Relation**:
  - Must be implemented by a derived class to handle the contents of `restApiProcessingResult`.
  - Called by `processResponse` to execute post-processing logic, like logging, data transformations, or storing results.

---

### **Other Key Points**
1. **`ITokenManager`**:
   - Provides token management functionality, ensuring the API calls are authenticated.
   - Used in `CallRestAPI` to retrieve tokens based on request configuration.
2. **`RestAPIProcessingResult`**:
   - Stores categorized responses from `CallRestAPI`.
   - Serves as input to `PostProcess` for further handling of API call results.

---

### **Overall Flow**
1. **`processRequest()`**:
   - Prepares requests using `PreProcess`.
   - Executes them with `CallRestAPI`.
2. **`CallRestAPI()`**:
   - Sends API requests, authenticates them, and processes responses.
   - Populates `restApiProcessingResult`.
3. **`processResponse()`**:
   - Handles the responses using `PostProcess`.
4. **Abstract Methods (`PreProcess` and `PostProcess`)**:
   - Allow derived classes to define custom logic before and after the API calls.

This structure ensures **separation of concerns**:
- `processRequest` handles request orchestration.
- `CallRestAPI` handles API communication.
- `processResponse` and `PostProcess` focus on handling results.
